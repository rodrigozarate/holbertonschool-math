# 0x02. Math - Integrals and ODE
In this section we will have only a quick idea about integrals. We will use loops and functions in order to calculate the integral of some functions. We will focus on two numerical methods: Rectangle and Simpson.
## Tasks
### 0. Rectangle Method 
Code the Rectangle Method and use it to calculate


    Prototype: double rectangle_method(double a, double b, int steps );
    You can use the library <math.h> in your code

#### File: 0-rectangle.c
### 1. Simpson Method 
Code the Simpson Method and use it to calculate

    Prototype: double simpson(double a, double b, int steps );
    You can use the library <math.h> in your code

#### File: 1-simpson.c
### 2. Simple Pendulum - part 1 
Code the Euler Method to solve the ODE
#### File: 0
### 3. Simple Pendulum - part 2 
With Gnuplot, plot the solution of the Pendulum equation with
