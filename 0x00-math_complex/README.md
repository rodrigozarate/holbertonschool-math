    Algebra operations.
    Absolute values.
    Cosinus and Sinus.
    The Cartesian plane.
    The Complex plane.
    Real part and Imaginary part of Complex Numbers.
    Modulus
    Argument
## Tasks

### 0. Structure Complex
mandatory

Build the structure “complex” where a complex number a + ib is represented by two doubles.

Write a function that displays the complex numbers, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void display_complex_number(complex c);
    You can use printf in your code
#### File: 0-display.c

### 1. Conjugate
Write a function that returns the conjugate of a given complex number.

    Prototype: complex conjugate(complex c);
#### File: 1-conjugate.c

### 2. Modulus
Write a function that returns the modulus of a given complex number.

    Prototype: double modulus(complex c);
    You can use the library <math.h> in your code
#### File: 2-modulus.c
### 3. Argument
Write a function that returns the argument of a given complex number.

    Prototype: double argument(complex c);
    You can use the library <math.h> in your code
#### File: 3-argument.c

### 4. Addition
Write a function that performs the addition operation to complex numbers.

    Prototype: void addition(complex c1, complex c2, complex *c3);
#### File: 4-addition.c


### 5. Substraction
Write a function that performs the substraction operation to complex numbers.

    Prototype: void substraction(complex c1, complex c2, complex *c3);

#### File: 5-substraction.c

### 6. Multiplication
Write a function that performs the multiplication operation to complex numbers.

    Prototype: void multiplication(complex c1, complex c2, complex *c3);
#### File: 6-multiplication.c

### 7. Division
Write a function that performs the division operation to complex numbers.

    Prototype: void division(complex c1, complex c2, complex *c3);
#### File: 7-division.c

### 8. Real and imaginary
Write a function that update the real and the imaginary parts of a complex number given its modulus and arguments.

    Prototype: void complex_from_mod_arg (double m, double arg, complex *c3);
    You can use the library <math.h> in your code
#### File: 8-complex.c
